# Fatal-Police-Shootings

https://clay-glad.shinyapps.io/Fatal_Police_Shootings/

This Shiny app (with Leaflet and Plotly) uses the Washington Post data
on fatal police shootings between 2015 and 2020. The app allows the 
user to filter by race, age, and sex. It then generates a Leaflet map
showing locations of all fatal shootings in that filter; popups indicate
the name of the victim and location of the shooting. It also generates a
Plotly pie chart to show what fraction of all fatal shootings are in
the filter.

Data is from the Washington Post GitHub:
